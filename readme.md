# chext_fill_form_from_json

try this json on this form  
<https://redux-form.com/6.5.0/examples/simple/>  
TODO: this does not work well because it looks like it is react.
So the data I enter are not saved in the background data.


```json
{
"firstName":"Luciano",
"lastName":"Bestia",
"email": "luciano@gmail.com",
"sex":"male",  
"favoriteColor":"Blue",
"employed":"true",
"notes":"some notes"
}
```
